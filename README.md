- Why TypeScript? 

  - Better tools that back the devs up (static type checking...) -> less bugs
  - Better code navigation - let the devs quickly figure out how the things are done or what's expected -> less bugs, faster progress
  - Productivity:
    - with JS, you code quickly but maintain slowly
    - with TS, you code slowly but maintain quickly
    - with JS, you spend more time fixing defects -> slower progress with new tasks
  - In the bottom line: TypeScript === less technical risk

- Why infrastructure layer? Let reusable modules emerge as we go.

- Why EditorHost? We can just use static imports across the packages.



- Why should EditorHost hold my extension slots? My feature can hold them privately instead. 



- Why should I always lookup APIs and slots through EditorHost? I can lookup once in the build time, then cache privately.



- Why bother separating build-time and run-time APIs?



- The typings look cryptographic! Can they be simplified?
